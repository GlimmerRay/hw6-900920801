Spotify api
There are endpoints
They return data about artists/albums/tracks
    So basically access to the db
You can also get user related info
The base address is...
    https://api.spotify.com
To access user info, 
    an application must get the users permission

Authorization
Two reasons
    User give your app approval to access they data
    Your app fetch data from spotify
There are 4 optional authorization flows
https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/

Authorization Code Flow
When you register your application,
    spotify provides you with a client id
There are certain required query parameters 
    and certain options
client_id is required
response_type = 'code' is required
redirect_uri is required
    gives the uri to redirect to after the users
    grants or denies permission
state is optional but highly recommended 
    for security purposes
scope - optional
    space separated list
    if none given, only publicly availabe information
        will be given. that is, information normally
        visible in the spotify desktop app
THIS NOT WHAT I NEED THO!

Client Credentials Flo (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#client-credentials-flow)
Used for server to server authentication (i.e. not from a browser)
Has a higher rate limit
can't get user data
the request is sent to the /api/token endpoint
make a post request
POST https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token
requires a body parameter 'grant type' set to 'client_credentials'
    if this don work do something bout urlencoded sum 
        (see tutorial)
the header parameter is 'Authorization' contains the client_id
    and the client secret key


How to get a access token?
